        In ethical philosophy, utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical
        theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being
        for all affected individuals.
        <br /> <br />
        Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different
        characterizations, the basic idea behind all of them is, in some sense,
        to maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being or
        related concepts. For instance, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of
        utilitarianism, described utility as:
        <br /> <br />
        That property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit,
        advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness ... [or] to prevent the
        happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose
        interest is considered.
        <br /> <br />
        Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the
        consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong.
        Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism,
        utilitarianism considers the interests of all sentient beings equally.
        Proponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of issues, such
        as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results (act
        utilitarianism), or whether agents should conform to rules that maximize
        utility (rule utilitarianism). There is also disagreement as to whether
        total utility (total utilitarianism), average utility (average
        utilitarianism) or the utility of the people worst-off should be
        maximized.
        <br /> <br />
        Though the seeds of the theory can be found in the hedonists Aristippus
        and Epicurus, who viewed happiness as the only good, and in the work of
        the medieval Indian philosopher Śāntideva, the tradition of modern
        utilitarianism began with Jeremy Bentham, and continued with such
        philosophers as John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, R. M. Hare, and Peter
        Singer. The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics,
        the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food,
        and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity.

        Optimism is an attitude reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of
        some specific endeavor, or outcomes in general, will be positive,
        favorable, and desirable. A common idiom used to illustrate optimism
        versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point: an
        optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees
        the glass as half empty.
        <br /> <br />
        The term derives from the Latin optimum, meaning "best". Being
        optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is defined as expecting
        the best possible outcome from any given situation. This is usually
        referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism. It thus reflects a
        belief that future conditions will work out for the best. For this
        reason, it is seen as a trait that fosters resilience in the face of
        stress.
        <br /> <br />
        Theories of optimism include dispositional models and models of
        explanatory style. Methods to measure optimism have been developed
        within both of these theoretical approaches, such as various forms of
        the Life Orientation Test for the original dispositional definition of
        optimism and the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test
        optimism in terms of explanatory style.
        <br /> <br />
        Variation in optimism and pessimism is somewhat heritable and reflects
        biological trait systems to some degree. It is also influenced by
        environmental factors, including family environment, with some
        suggesting it can be learned. Optimism may also be linked to health.

        Pessimism is a negative mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome
        is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the
        negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for
        pessimism is "Is the glass half empty or half full?"; in this situation,
        a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an optimist is
        said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic
        disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.

        Humanism is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the individual and
        social potential and agency of human beings. It considers human beings
        the starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry.
        <br /> <br />
        The meaning of the term "humanism" has changed according to the
        successive intellectual movements that have identified with it. During
        the Italian Renaissance, ancient works inspired scholars in various
        Italian cities, giving rise to a movement now called Renaissance
        humanism. With Enlightenment, humanistic values were re-enforced by the
        advances in science and technology, giving confidence to humans in their
        exploration of the world. By the early 20th century, organizations
        solely dedicated to humanism flourished in Europe and the United States,
        and have since expanded all over the globe. In the current day, the term
        generally refers to a focus on human well-being and advocates for human
        freedom, autonomy, and progress. It views humanity as responsible for
        the promotion and development of individuals, espouses the equal and
        inherent dignity of all human beings, and emphasizes a concern for
        humans in relation to the world.
        <br /> <br />
        Starting in the 20th century, humanist movements have typically been
        non-religious and aligned with secularism. Most frequently, humanism
        refers to a nontheistic view centered on human agency, and a reliance on
        science and reason rather than revelation from a supernatural source to
        understand the world. Humanists tend to advocate for human rights, free
        speech, progressive policies, and democracy. Those with a humanist
        worldview maintain religion is not a precondition of morality, and
        object to excessive religious entanglement with education and the state.
        <br /> <br />
        Contemporary humanist organizations work under the umbrella of Humanists
        International. Well known humanist associations are the Humanists UK and
        the American Humanist Association.

    title: "Absurdism",
    shortDescription: <></>,
    description: (
      <>
        Absurdism is the philosophical theory that existence in general is
        absurd. This implies that the world lacks meaning or a higher purpose
        and is not fully intelligible by reason. The term "absurd" also has a
        more specific sense in the context of absurdism: it refers to a conflict
        or a discrepancy between two things but there are several disagreements
        about their exact nature. These disagreements have various consequences
        for whether absurdism is true and for the arguments cited in favor and
        against it. Popular accounts characterize the conflict as a collision
        between rational man and an irrational universe, between intention and
        outcome, or between subjective assessment and objective worth. An
        important aspect of absurdism is its claim that the world as a whole is
        absurd. It differs in this regard from the uncontroversial and less
        global thesis that some particular situations, persons, or phases in
        life are absurd.
        <br /> <br />
        Various components of the absurd are discussed in the academic
        literature and different theorists frequently concentrate their
        definition and research on different components. On the practical level,
        the conflict underlying the absurd is characterized by the individual's
        struggle to find meaning in a meaningless world. The theoretical
        component, on the other hand, emphasizes more the epistemic inability of
        reason to penetrate and understand reality. Traditionally, the conflict
        is characterized as a collision between an internal component, belonging
        to human nature, and an external component, belonging to the nature of
        the world. However, some later theorists have suggested that both
        components may be internal: the capacity to see through the
        arbitrariness of any ultimate purpose, on the one hand, and the
        incapacity to stop caring about such purposes, on the other hand.
        Certain accounts also involve a metacognitive component by holding that
        an awareness of the conflict is necessary for the absurd to arise.
        <br /> <br />
        Some arguments in favor of absurdism focus on the human insignificance
        in the universe, on the role of death, or on the implausibility or
        irrationality of positing an ultimate purpose. Objections to absurdism
        often contend that life is in fact meaningful or point out certain
        problematic consequences or inconsistencies of absurdism. Defenders of
        absurdism often complain that it does not receive the attention of
        professional philosophers it merits in virtue of the topic's importance
        and its potential psychological impact on the affected individuals in
        the form of existential crises. Various possible responses to deal with
        absurdism and its impact have been suggested. The three responses
        discussed in the traditional absurdist literature are suicide, religious
        belief in a higher purpose, and rebellion against the absurd. Of these,
        rebellion is usually presented as the recommended response since, unlike
        the other two responses, it does not escape the absurd and instead
        recognizes it for what it is. Later theorists have suggested additional
        responses, like using irony to take life less seriously or remaining
        ignorant of the responsible conflict. Some absurdists argue that whether
        and how one responds is insignificant. This is based on the idea that if
        nothing really matters then the human response toward this fact does not
        matter either.
        <br /> <br />
        The term "absurdism" is most closely associated with the philosophy of
        Albert Camus. However, important precursors and discussions of the
        absurd are also found in the works of Søren Kierkegaard. Absurdism is
        intimately related to various other concepts and theories. Its basic
        outlook is inspired by existentialist philosophy. However,
        existentialism includes additional theoretical commitments and often
        takes a more optimistic attitude toward the possibility of finding or
        creating meaning in one's life. Absurdism and nihilism share the belief
        that life is meaningless. But absurdists do not treat this as an
        isolated fact and are instead interested in the conflict between the
        human desire for meaning and the world's lack thereof. Being confronted
        with this conflict may trigger an existential crisis, in which
        unpleasant experiences like anxiety or depression may push the affected
        to find a response for dealing with the conflict. Recognizing the
        absence of objective meaning, however, does not preclude the conscious
        thinker from finding subjective meaning in arbitrary places.

        Marxism is a left-wing to far-left method of socioeconomic analysis that
        uses a materialist interpretation of historical development, better
        known as historical materialism, to understand class relations and
        social conflict and a dialectical perspective to view social
        transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German
        philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. As Marxism has developed
        over time into various branches and schools of thought, no single,
        definitive Marxist theory exists.
        <hr />
        In addition to the schools of thought which emphasize or modify elements
        of classical Marxism, various Marxian concepts have been incorporated
        and adapted into a diverse array of social theories leading to widely
        varying conclusions. Alongside Marx's critique of political economy, the
        defining characteristics of Marxism have often been described using the
        terms dialectical materialism and historical materialism, though these
        terms were coined after Marx's death and their tenets have been
        challenged by some self-described Marxists.
        <br />
        <br />
        Marxism has had a profound impact on global academia, having influenced
        many fields, including anthropology, archaeology, art theory,
        criminology, cultural studies, economics, education, ethics, film
        theory, geography, historiography, literary criticism, media studies,
        philosophy, political science, political economy, psychology, science
        studies, sociology, urban planning, and theatre.

        Hedonism refers to a family of theories, all of which have in common
        that pleasure plays a central role in them. Psychological or
        motivational hedonism claims that human behavior is determined by
        desires to increase pleasure and to decrease pain. Normative or ethical
        hedonism, on the other hand, is not about how we actually act but how we
        ought to act: we should pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Axiological
        hedonism, which is sometimes treated as a part of ethical hedonism, is
        the thesis that only pleasure has intrinsic value. Applied to well-being
        or what is good for someone, it is the thesis that pleasure and
        suffering are the only components of well-being. These technical
        definitions of hedonism within philosophy, which are usually seen as
        respectable schools of thought, have to be distinguished from how the
        term is used in everyday language, sometimes referred to as "folk
        hedonism". In this sense, it has a negative connotation, linked to the
        egoistic pursuit of short-term gratification by indulging in sensory
        pleasures without regard for the consequences.

        <h3>The nature of pleasure</h3>
        <hr />
        Pleasure plays a central role in all forms of hedonism; it refers to
        experience that feels good and involves the enjoyment of something.
        Pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling
        bad. Discussions within hedonism usually focus more on pleasure, but as
        its negative side, pain is equally implied in these discussions. Both
        pleasure and pain come in degrees and have been thought of as a
        dimension going from positive degrees through a neutral point to
        negative degrees. The term "happiness" is often used in this tradition
        to refer to the balance of pleasure over pain.
        <br />
        <br />
        In everyday language, the term "pleasure" is primarily associated with
        sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex. But in its most
        general sense, it includes all types of positive or pleasant experiences
        including the enjoyment of sports, seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging
        in an intellectually satisfying activity. Theories of pleasure try to
        determine what all these pleasurable experiences have in common, what is
        essential to them. They are traditionally divided into quality theories
        and attitude theories. Quality theories hold that pleasure is a quality
        of pleasurable experiences themselves while attitude theories state that
        pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on
        the subject's attitude to the experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        The plausibility of the various versions of hedonism is affected by how
        the nature of pleasure is conceived.An important appeal of most forms of
        hedonism is that they are able to give a simple and unified account of
        their respective fields. But this is only possible if pleasure itself is
        a unified phenomenon. This has been put into question, mainly due to the
        wide variety of pleasure experiences which seem to have no one shared
        feature in common. One way open to quality theorists to respond to this
        objection is by pointing out that the hedonic tone of
        pleasure-experiences is not a regular quality but a higher-order
        quality. Attitude theories have an easier way to reply to this argument
        since they may hold that it is the same type of attitude, often
        identified with desire, that is common to all pleasurable experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Psychological hedonism</h3>
        <hr />
        Psychological hedonism, also known as motivational hedonism, is an
        empirical theory about what motivates us: it states that all our actions
        aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain. This is usually understood
        in combination with egoism, i.e. that each person only aims at their own
        happiness. Our actions rely on beliefs about what causes pleasure. False
        beliefs may mislead us and thus our actions may fail to result in
        pleasure, but even failed actions are motivated by considerations of
        pleasure, according to psychological hedonism. The paradox of hedonism
        concerns the thesis that pleasure-seeking behavior is actually
        self-defeating in the sense that it results in less actual pleasure than
        would result from following other motives.
        <br /> <br />
        Psychological hedonism gives a straightforward theory explaining the
        totality of human behavior. It has intuitive plausibility because
        pleasure-seeking behavior is a common phenomenon, and may indeed
        dominate human conduct at times; however, the generalization of
        psychological hedonism as an explanation for all behavior is highly
        controversial. Critics point to counterexamples involving actions that
        seem to have no plausible explanation in terms of pleasure, such as
        egoistic motives for things other than pleasure (e.g. health,
        self-improvement, post-mortem fame), and altruistic motives (e.g.
        pursuing one's child's happiness, sacrificing one's life for a greater
        cause).Psychological hedonists reinterpret such cases in terms of
        pleasure-seeking behavior, for example positing that seeing one's
        children happy or knowing that one's death will have been meaningful
        brings pleasure to the person sacrificing their immediate pleasure.
        <br /> <br />
        Critics also contend that, via introspection, one can conclude that
        pursuit of pleasure is only one type of motivating force among others,
        and that reinterpreting every case in terms of pleasure/pain contradicts
        this.Critics also contend that psychological hedonism's basic claim of
        what motivates humans falls within the realm of the science of
        psychology rather than philosophy, and as such demands experimental
        evidence to confirm or contradict it.

        Existentialism is the philosophical belief we are each responsible for
        creating purpose or meaning in our own lives. Our individual purpose and
        meaning is not given to us by Gods, governments, teachers or other
        authorities.
        <hr />
        Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the
        problem of human existence and centers on human thinking, feeling, and
        acting. Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the
        meaning, purpose, and value of human existence, and the role of personal
        agency in transforming one's life. In the view of an existentialist, the
        individual's starting point is phenomenological, grounded in the
        immediate direct experience of life. Key concepts include "existential
        angst", a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or anxiety in the
        face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world, and also
        authenticity, courage, and human-heartedness.
        <br /> <br />
        Existentialism is associated with several 19th- and 20th-century
        European philosophers who shared an emphasis on the human subject,
        despite often profound differences in thought. Among the earliest
        figures associated with existentialism are philosophers Søren
        Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche and novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, all
        of whom critiqued rationalism and concerned themselves with the problem
        of meaning. In the 20th century, prominent existentialist thinkers
        included Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Simone de
        Beauvoir, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, and Paul Tillich.
        <br /> <br />
        Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic
        philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from
        concrete human experience.A primary virtue in existentialist thought is
        authenticity. Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of
        philosophy, including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.

        Finitism is a philosophy of mathematics that accepts the existence only
        of finite mathematical objects. It is best understood in comparison to
        the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical
        objects (e.g., infinite sets) are accepted as legitimate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Main idea</h3>
        <hr />
        The main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence
        of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are
        accepted as existing, the set of all natural numbers is not considered
        to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore quantification over
        infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory
        often associated with finitism is Thoralf Skolem's primitive recursive
        arithmetic.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        The introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few
        centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a
        controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase
        when Georg Cantor in 1874 introduced what is now called naive set theory
        and used it as a base for his work on transfinite numbers. When
        paradoxes such as Russell's paradox, Berry's paradox and the
        Burali-Forti paradox were discovered in Cantor's naive set theory, the
        issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.
        <br />
        <br />
        There were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about
        finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were
        disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. One position was
        the intuitionistic mathematics that was advocated by L. E. J. Brouwer,
        which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are
        constructed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another position was endorsed by David Hilbert: finite mathematical
        objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal
        objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a
        problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert
        believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite
        mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects
        can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite
        mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects.
        This led to Hilbert's program of proving both consistency and
        completeness of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply
        that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the
        finitistic part. Hilbert's views are also associated with the formalist
        philosophy of mathematics. Hilbert's goal of proving the consistency and
        completeness of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means
        turned out to be an impossible task due to Kurt Gödel's incompleteness
        theorems. However, Harvey Friedman's grand conjecture would imply that
        most mathematical results are provable using finitistic means.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered
        finitistic and referred to as elementary. However, based on his work
        with Paul Bernays some experts such as William Tait have argued that the
        primitive recursive arithmetic can be considered an upper bound on what
        Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a result of Gödel's theorems, as it became clear that there is no
        hope of proving both the consistency and completeness of mathematics,
        and with the development of seemingly consistent axiomatic set theories
        such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, most modern mathematicians do not
        focus on this topic. Today, most mathematicians are considered Platonist
        and readily use infinite mathematical objects and a set-theoretical
        universe.

        <br />
        <br />
        Scholars of nihilism may regard it as merely a label that has been
        applied to various separate philosophies, or as a distinct historical
        concept arising out of nominalism, skepticism, and philosophical
        pessimism, as well as possibly out of Christianity itself. Contemporary
        understanding of the idea stems largely from the Nietzschean 'crisis of
        nihilism', from which derive the two central concepts: the destruction
        of higher values and the opposition to the affirmation of life. Earlier
        forms of nihilism, however, may be more selective in negating specific
        hegemonies of social, moral, political and aesthetic thought.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the
        general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence or
        arbitrariness of human principles and social institutions. Nihilism has
        also been described as conspicuous in or constitutive of certain
        historical periods. For example, Jean Baudrillard and others have
        characterized postmodernity as a nihilistic epoch or mode of thought.
        Likewise, some theologians and religious figures have stated that
        postmodernity and many aspects of modernity represent nihilism by a
        negation of religious principles. Nihilism has, however, been widely
        ascribed to both religious and irreligious viewpoints.
        <br />
        <br />
        In popular use, the term commonly refers to forms of existential
        nihilism, according to which life is without intrinsic value, meaning,
        or purpose. Other prominent positions within nihilism include the
        rejection of all normative and ethical views (§ Moral nihilism), the
        rejection of all social and political institutions (§ Political
        nihilism), the stance that no knowledge can or does exist (§
        Epistemological nihilism), and a number of metaphysical positions, which
        assert that non-abstract objects do not exist ( Metaphysical nihilism),
        that composite objects do not exist ( Mereological nihilism), or even
        that life itself does not exist.

        Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium
        in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is a philosophy of personal
        eudaemonic virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views
        on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both
        necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia—flourishing by means of
        living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia
        with a life spent practicing the cardinal virtues and living in
        accordance with nature.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only
        good" for human beings, and those external things—such as health,
        wealth, and pleasure—are not good nor bad in themselves (adiaphora) but
        have value as "material for virtue to act upon." Alongside Aristotelian
        ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches
        to virtue ethics. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions
        resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to
        maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is "in accordance with
        nature". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an
        individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person
        behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the
        natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

        Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule composed of two chains that coil
        around each other to form a double helix carrying the genetic
        instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and
        reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and
        ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and
        complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the
        four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known
        forms of life. The two DNA strands are also known as polynucleotides as
        they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each
        nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases
        (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called
        deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one
        another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide
        and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating
        sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate
        polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base-pairing
        rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make
        double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided
        into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are
        thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine. Both strands
        of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This
        information is replicated as and when the two strands separate.
        <br />
        <br />
        A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning
        that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The
        two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus
        antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases
        (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along
        the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created
        using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under
        the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids
        within proteins in a process called translation. Within eukaryotic
        cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before
        typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process
        of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each
        daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and
        protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear
        DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA, or in
        chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and
        archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes.
        Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones,
        compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the
        interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts
        of the DNA are transcribed.
        <br />
        <br />
        DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular
        structure was first identified by Francis Crick and James Watson at the
        Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose
        model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by
        Raymond Gosling, who was a post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin.
        DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws
        and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity.
        The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive
        molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and
        nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami
        and DNA-based hybrid materials.

        Biotechnology is the use of technology to modify or manipulate living
        systems or parts of living systems for the generation of useful
        products, biological processing to treat disease or to acquire
        knowledge. Products manufactured or processed using biotechnology are
        found in agricultural, pharmaceutical, food, chemical, and biofuel
        industries. Biotechnology is also used in waste treatment.

        <h3>Biotechnology fundamentals</h3>
        Biotechnology is used to modify living systems or parts of living
        systems based on knowledge about essential parts or processes which
        allow living things to grow, reproduce, use resources and respond to
        their environment.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        Solana is an open-source project implementing a permissionless
        blockchain. The Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland and
        maintains the open-source project. The company's decentralized
        blockchain platform offers concurrent GPU-parallelization and uses a
        Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism for higher speed than
        competitor blockchains, with low latency and reduced cost of
        transaction, all at layer-1 and without sharding. According to Solana,
        the blockchain is capable of 710,000 transactions per second on a
        1-gigabit network without data partitioning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Solana was founded in 2017 and was officially launched in March 2020 by
        the Solana Foundation. The protocol is designed to facilitate
        decentralized applications (dApp) creation, as well as improve the
        scalability through the Proof of History consensus. Similar to Ethereum,
        Solana is a cryptocurrency and a flexible platform for running dApps.
        The speed of the network is intended to reduce congestion on the network
        and reduce network fees, in order to entice new developers and help
        Solana scale. Solana uses a native cryptocurrency, SOL, which is used to
        pay transaction fees and for staking for governance.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Proof of History concept</h3>
        <hr />
        Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper in 2017 to describe
        the Proof of History (PoH) concept that would be adopted by the Solana
        blockchain. This consensus mechanism uses order and passage of time
        between events to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger. This
        is intended to reduce the slowdowns in other networks that can be caused
        by the network using a participant or network nodes local clock. The
        lack of a trusted source of time, or a standardized clock, caused some
        transactions to be accepted or rejected erroneously and caused network

        <h3>Network architecture</h3>
        <hr />
        The Solana architecture offers features common to other networks, such
        as smart contracting, transaction settlement, and token issuance. The
        Solana network works to offer better settlement speeds and higher
        capacity for transactions in comparison to other blockchain networks. It
        works to achieve this through eight core components of the network,
        including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Proof of History—creates a common schedule across all participants
          </li>
          <li>Gulf Stream—defines when and how transactions are exchanged</li>
          <li>
            Sealevel—a processing engine to assign the order and execution of
            transactions
          </li>
          <li>
            Turbine—defines how node validate transactions and send and receive
            blocks
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloudbreak—a memory mechanism to keep track of participant balances
          </li>
          <li>Pipeline—verifies each component of a transaction</li>
          <li>
            Archivers—a network of nodes where data is off-loaded from
            validators and stored in perpetuity
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>SOL</h3>
        <hr />
        The governance token of the Solana blockchain, SOL, is the blockchain's
        native cryptocurrency. This utility and governance token is used to pay
        the transaction fees of the network and can be staked for governance of
        the blockchain network.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        The Solana company notes its founding starts with Anatoly Yakovenko's
        2017 whitepaper on the Proof of History. This was based on his
        experience designing distributed systems as Qualcomm, Mesosphere, and
        Dropbox, where he knew a reliable clock makes network synchronization
        simpler. This was to develop a blockchain that was faster than Bitcoin
        and Ethereum, which have struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per
        second globally, while centralized systems, such as Visa, can process
        65,000 transactions per second. With the change, Solana suggests the
        company's blockchain is capable of processing 710,000 transactions per
        second on a 1-gigabit ethernet network.
        <br />
        <br />
        Solana co-founder Greg Fitzgerald worked with Anatoly Yakovenko on the
        initial implementation of Proof of History, encouraging Yakovenko to
        change the programming language of the project to the Rust programming
        language, which Fitzgerald has maintained guarantees safety for improved
        software productivity. The resulting project was published to GitHub
        under the name Silk in 2018. This early release demonstrated 10 thousand
        signed transactions that were verified and processed in over half a
        second. Yakovenko recruited Fitzgerald along with others to cofound a
        company based on this consensus mechanism.
        <br />
        <br />
        Around this time, the company was founded, initially known as Loom,
        until an Ethereum-based project Loom Network was also developed. The
        team changed its name to Solana, in a nod to a small beach where
        co-founders Yakovenko, Fitzgerald, and Stephen Akridge lived while they
        worked together at Qualcomm.

        Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the
        Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an
        international network of public nodes. Ethereum also provides a
        cryptocurrency token called "Ether", which can be transferred between
        accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations
        performed. Gas (Ethereum), an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is
        used to prevent spam and allocate resources on the network.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Ethereum network runs on a blockchain which is secured by miners.
        These miners run a Proof-of-work system consensus algorithm called
        Ethash. There are future plans to move to a Proof-of-stake consensus
        algorithm.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Origins</h4>
        Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum protocol in his 2013 whitepaper
        with the goal of creating a general purpose blockchain platform to
        support decentralized applications and smart contracts. Buterin had
        previously contributed within the Bitcoin developer community and found
        limitations to the Bitcoin scripting language including lack of
        Turing-completeness, value-blindness, lack of state, and
        blockchain-blindness. Ethereum was formally announced at the North
        American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida.
        <br />
        <br />
        In early 2014 additional developers joined Buterin, including Gavin Wood
        and Jeffrey Wilcke listed as Lead C++ Developer and Lead Go Developer
        respectively as well as Anthony Di Iorio, Mihai Alisie, Joseph Lubin,
        and Stephen Tual in primarily non-development roles. The Ethereum
        Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) was founded in July 2014 in Switzerland.
        <br />
        <br />
        By April 2014, Gavin Wood published the Ethereum Yellow Paper describing
        the formal definition and technical specifications of the Ethereum
        Virtual Machine (EVM).
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Fundraising</h4>
        Ethereum was funded by an initial coin offering (ICO) launched in July
        2014. According to the Ethereum foundation, within the first two weeks
        more than 50 million ETH were sold. In total, the 42-day public ether
        pre-sale raised 31,591 bitcoins worth approximately $18 million dollars
        at the time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Pre-launch</h4>
        Prior to the official launch of Ethereum, a series of proof of concept
        versions of were released culminating in the beta release named Olympic
        on May 9th, 2015. The purpose of Olympic was to engage the community to
        stress test the network, build decentralized applications, and start
        running nodes. Total rewards of 25,000 ethers were distributed to
        community members for contributions in the four categories of
        transaction activity, virtual machine usage, mining prowess, and general
        punishment.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Frontier release</h4>
        The initial public launch named Frontier was released on July 30, 2015.
        This release provided instructions for generating the first block in the
        ethereum blockchain known as the genesis block, which was created with a
        unique parameter from the hash of the Ethereum testnet block #1028201
        and contained all transactions from the Ethereum crowdsale.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Homestead release</h4>
        The second major release of Ethereum named Homestead went live on March
        14th, 2016 on block 1,150,000. Homestead included protocol changes
        providing changes to the network giving increased ability for further
        upgrades, improved transaction speed, and improved security.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Metropolis (Byzantium)</h4>
        The Metropolis release will be split into two parts - the first of which
        called Byzantium was released on block 4,370,000 on October 16, 2017.
        The Byzantium release introduced privacy features zk-snarks and
        zero-knowledge proofs to the Ethereum blockchain, a feature added due to
        collaboration with the developers of Zcash including Zooko Wilcox.
        Additionally, the Metropolis release will include account abstraction,
        returndata, and revert capabilities. The release date for second part of
        metropolis named Constantinople has not yet been determined.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)</h4>
        The last planned release of Ethereum originally named Serenity plans to
        include features to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus
        protocol to the a proof-of-stake based on the Casper protocol being
        developed by Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, and others. Ethereum 2.0 is
        planned to come in four phases that incrementally adds features such as
        the Beacon Chain (Phase 0), Shard Chains (Phase 1), Sharded Mainnet
        (Phase 1.5), and Fully Formed Shards (Phase 2).

    shortDescription: (
      <>
        Mathematical hash function that is cryptographically secure and has the
        properties of collision resistance, hiding, and puzzle friendliness
      </>
    ),
    description: (
      <>
        A cryptographic hash function is a hash function that takes an arbitrary
        amount of data as input, applies some algorithm, and generates a
        fixed-sized output data. This alphanumeric string output value is also
        referred to as "hash value", "checksum", or "digital fingerprint." Hash
        functions - regardless of whether or not they are cyrptographically
        secure - also have the property of being efficiently computable, meaning
        that an output of the hash function can be found in a reasonable time
        period for any given input.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are three main properties that differentiate ordinary hash
        functions from cryptographic hash functions:
        <ul>
          <li>Collision resistance</li>
          <li>Hiding</li>
          <li>Puzzle friendliness</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Collision Resistance</h3>
        <hr />
        In order for a hash function to be collision resistant, it must be
        infeasible to find two unique data inputs that produce the same data
        output. The event of two inputs having an identical output is called a
        "collision."
        <br />
        <br />
        This property is critical for maintaining data integrity because it
        ensures that data cannot be changed retroactively without leaving an
        obvious indication of the change occurring. In other words, anybody can
        easily verify that data has not changed if that data was run through a
        cryptographic hash function and the output hash value is the same. This
        is because the only way to produce that specific output is with the
        specific input initially used.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Hiding</h3>
        <hr />
        The hiding property of cryptographic hash functions states that for any
        given hash output, there's no feasible way to figure out what the input
        was. The input is hidden despite the output being visible to anybody.
        <br />
        <br />A more mathematical way to describe this hiding property is to say
        that for any given probability distribution that contains a secret value
        'r', there is no way to taken a random sample from the distribution
        that's any more likely to be the secret value 'r' than any other random
        data sample. Given an adequately spread out probability distribution
        (i.e. one that has a high min-entropy), the probability of randomly
        finding 'r' by sampling the data set is infinitesimally small, thus
        making it infeasible to learn a data input just by knowing the hash
        output.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Puzzle Friendliness</h3>
        <hr />
        In order for a hash function to be considered puzzle friendly, it must
        be true that there is not a strategy for solving a computational puzzle
        based on the hash function that's more effective than simply trying
        random values from a set of possible solutions until one of them works.
        <br />
        The mathematical description for this puzzle friendliness property is
        somewhat complicated. It says that for every possible n-bit (e.g. n =
        256 for SHA-256) output value of a hash function, if possible solutions
        are chosen from a probability distribution with high min-entropy, then
        it is infeasible to find the solution for the given output value in a
        time significantly less than 2^n.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Applications of Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
        <hr />
        Cryptographic hash functions have a variety of uses in different areas
        of cryptography. For example, they are used in password protection,
        message authentication, key derivation functions, and in pseudo-random
        number generators, among other applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rely heavily on cryptographic hash
        functions for data security. Public-key cryptography uses cryptographic
        hash functions to enable users to have public wallet addresses that they
        can share in order to receive transactions along with corresponding
        private keys that are used for digital signatures to authenticate
        outgoing transactions. Additionally, cryptographic hash functions are an
        integral part of the various cryptocurrency mining consensus systems
        that exist such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        Game theory is a branch of mathematics focused on strategic decision
        making. It is used to model the strategic interaction between
        independent and competing players in a context where rules and outcomes
        are predefined. Game theory has numerous applications in all social
        sciences, and has also been applied to logic, system sciences, computer
        science and especially economics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Game theory can be applied any time there is a situation with two or
        more players that involves known payouts or measurable consequences. The
        key concept of game theory is that one player's gain is contingent upon
        any strategy executed by the other player. Assuming all players are
        rational beings who are utility maximizing, game theory can be used to
        calculate the most likely outcomes of these situations.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Key Terms</h3>
        <hr /> Below are some common terms that are often used to describe
        scenarios in which game theory can be applied:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Game—any set of circumstances that has an outcome dependent on the
            actions of two or more decision-makers, often called "players"
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            Player—a strategic, rational decision maker in the context of the
            game
          </li>
          <li>
            Strategy—an absolute plan of action that a player will take given
            the set of circumstances that may reveal themselves within the game
          </li>
          <li>
            Payoff—the payout or gain a player receives from arriving on a
            specific outcome. The payout can be anything quantifiable, from
            money to utility
          </li>
          <li>
            Information set—information available to the players at a given
            point in the game. In games with a sequential component, this term
            is most often used{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Equilibrium—the point in a game where both players have made their
            decisions and arrived at an outcome
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Types of Games</h3>
        <hr />
        Game theory can be further divided into five main types of games:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cooperative vs. non-cooperative games: Cooperative games are games
            in which players can form alliances in order to maximize their
            chances of achieving positive outcomes. Adversely, participants may
            not form alliances and must work independently in non-cooperative
            games.
          </li>
          <li>
            Symmetric vs. asymmetric games: In symmetric games, strategies that
            are adopted by all players are the same. This is only possible
            within a short-term game, because in long-term games, options
            increase as the game is played. In asymmetrical games, on the other
            hand, the strategies adopted by the players differ from each other,
            and what benefits one player may adversely affect another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perfect vs. imperfect information games: In perfect information
            games, all players are aware of the other players' moves, such as in
            a game of chess. In imperfect information games, the players may be
            unaware or ignorant of another players moves.
          </li>
          <li>
            simultaneous vs. sequential Games: In simultaneous games, all
            players in the game make moves concurrently, or if not concurrently,
            a player is unaware of another player's move before making their own
            move. In sequential games, players have some knowledge about earlier
            actions taken in the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zero-sum vs. Non-zero-sum Games: In zero-sum games, a player can
            only benefit or gain something at the expense of another player.
            Adversely, in non-zero-sum games, multiple players are able to take
            benefit of the gains of another player.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Nash Equilibrium</h4>
        The Nash Equilibrium is a concept within game theory where the most
        favorable outcome of a game can be achieved if the players stick to
        their initial plans and don't deviate from their initial strategy. In
        other words, there is no incentive for a player to change their chosen
        strategy after considering their opponent's choice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Nash Equilibrium is one of the most well-known concepts within game
        theory. It is commonly illustrated with a situation known as the
        Prisoner's Dilemma. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, two prisoners (the
        players) are arrested for a crime and brought into separate rooms to be
        interrogated. The prisoners have no way of communicating with each other
        or knowing what the other player will choose. Officials present four
        deals, which are often displayed in a punnet square.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If both prisoners confess to the crime, they will each receive five
            years in jail.
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            If Prisoner A confesses to the crime and rats on Prisoner B,
            Prisoner A will be set free, while Prisoner B will serve ten years
            in jail.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            If Prisoner B confesses to the crime and rats on Prisoner A,
            Prisoner B will be set free and Prisoner A will serve ten years in
            jail.
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            If neither prisoner confesses to the crime, both Prisoner A and
            Prisoner B will serve one year in jail.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://golden-storage-production.s3.amazonaws.com/topic_images/6618b19b17754e2187329c3b93e154d2.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        In this scenario, the most beneficial choice for each prisoner is to
        stick to their original plan of not confessing to the crime, as it is
        the most fruitful choice for both of them collectively. The Nash
        Equilibrium suggests that the most likely outcome would be that both men
        confess to the crime, each opting for the best choice for them
        individually, but worse for them as a whole.

        Game theory has its origins in the work of mathematician John von
        Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s. Von Neumann and
        Morgenstern initially developed game theory to solve problems in
        economics. In their book The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, Von
        Neumann and Morgenstern asserted that mathematics for physical sciences
        could not be reasonably applied to economics. They described economics
        as being much like a game, with strategic players who anticipate and
        react to each others moves, and laid out the basic framework for the
        field of game theory.

        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h4>
        Principles and concepts of game theory have been applied to the field of
        artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with multi-agent AI systems,
        Imitation and Reinforcement Learning, and Adversary training in
        Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Game theory can also be used to
        describe many situations found in daily life and machine learning (ML)
        models. For example, in an Adversary training in GANs, the two models
        used, a generative model and a discriminative model, can be viewed as
        two players in a game. The two models are challenging each other, with
        the generative model creating fake samples to confuse the other, and the
        discriminative model learning to be better at identifying the right
        sample. Much like a game, this process will repeat until Nash
        Equilibrium is reached and the two models become proficient at
        performing their tasks and are unable to improve.
        <br />
        <br />
        Game theory in AI has been explored in programs at Stanford and within
        the US government, although officials say that incorporating AI into US
        government programs is a "work in progress." The Information Innovation
        Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency director William
        Scherlis has said in order to do strategy planning within AI, combining
        game theory elements with machine learning would be important.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        Cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secure
        communication, allowing only the sender and intended recipient of a
        message to view its contents. Cryptography is closely related to
        encryption, the process of scrambling readable text such that it can
        only be read by people with a secret code, or decryption key.
        Cryptography also covers hiding information in images through techniques
        such as microdots or merging.
        <br />
        <br />
        The term, cryptography, is derived from the Greek word kryptos (meaning
        hidden), and its practice dates back through history. The ancient
        Egyptians were known to use cryptographic methods in complex
        hieroglyphics and Julius Caesar is credited as using one of the first
        modern ciphers. The "Caesar cipher" uses a simple substitution technique
        to encrypt information by shifting letters a fixed number of positions
        through the alphabet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Modern cryptography has become vital for computer and communications
        security. It is based on a range of mathematical concepts including
        number theory, computational complexity theory, and probability theory.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are five primary functions of cryptography:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Privacy/confidentiality—ensuring only the intended receiver can
            read messages sent{" "}
          </li>
          <li>2. Authentication—proving one's identity</li>

          <li>
            3. Integrity—the assurance that the message has not been altered
            from the original{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Non-repudiation—proving the sender is the one sending the message
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Key exchange—sharing of crypto keys are shared between sender and
            receiver.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Types</h3>
        <hr />
        There are several ways of dividing modern cryptographic algorithms
        including the number of keys required and the intended use. The
        following are three common types of cryptographic algorithms:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Symmetric encryption—uses a single key for both encryption and
            decryption
          </li>
          <li>
            Asymmetric encryption—uses separate keys for encryption and
            decryption
          </li>
          <li>
            Hash Functions—uses a mathematical transformation to irreversibly
            encrypt information providing a digital fingerprint
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Cryptanalysis</h3>
        <hr />
        Cryptanalysis is a closely related field to cryptography, concerned with
        the decryption and analysis of codes, ciphers, or encrypted text.
        Cryptanalysis uses mathematical formulas to find algorithm
        vulnerabilities to break cryptography or information security systems.
        Examples of cryptanalysis attacks include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Known-Plaintext Analysis</li>
          <li>Chosen-Plaintext Analysis</li>
          <li>Ciphertext-Only Analysis</li>
          <li>Man-in-the-Middle Attack</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <hr />
        Modern cryptography has a range of applications, such as providing
        secure communication and data protection across a range of fields
        including eCommerce and the military.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrency</h3>
        <hr />
        Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are made possible through asymmetric
        cryptography. Each transaction is recorded to the blockchain ledger
        using encrypted data, with users accessing their information and making
        transactions using a public and private key. Blockchains also use hash
        functions to securely record and store transactions. Through
        cryptographic hashing, newly verified transactions can be irreversibly
        added to a blockchain.

    shortDescription: (
      <>
        A blockchain is an append-only digital ledger storing a set of
        time-ordered transactions grouped in blocks that are linked together
        using cryptographic hashes.
      </>
    ),
    description: (
      <>
        A blockchain is a type of digital ledger where transactions grouped into
        blocks are replicated across a network of participants. Blockchains can
        enable a decentralized ledger system of transactions which does not rely
        on any central authority or trusted third parties for transaction
        validation. All participants in the peer-to-peer network are known as
        nodes, and maintain a full record of all transactions on the blockchain
        communicating directly following a protocol that forms a distributed
        consensus on the next valid block in the chain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each block in the blockchain contains a timestamp, transactional data,
        and a cryptographic hash link to the previous block. This creates a
        time-ordered chain of links from the genesis block to the most recent
        block that cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all
        subsequent blocks, requiring a collusion of a large portion of the
        network.

        <br />
        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        Early work on cryptographically secure chains with timestamps was done
        by Haber and Stornetta, including their 1991 paper “How to Time-Stamp a
        Digital Document". Building upon their previous work, Haber, Stornetta
        and Bayer published “Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital
        Time-Stamping", which incorporated consideration of costs and benefits
        of three methods of digital timestamping including; linear linking,
        random witness, and merkle trees. Massias, Avila, and Quisquater
        extended this work to reduce the trust requirements for these digital
        timestamps.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2004, Hal Finney created and implemented reusable proofs of work
        (RPOW) drawing inspiration from Adam Back's hashcash. Key innovations
        also came from Wei Dai's b-money. Nick Szabo’s utilizes these ideas for
        timestamped proof of work to create a string of distributed property
        title registry for Bit gold. In 2008, an individual or group of
        individuals, released the bitcoin whitepaper under the name Satoshi
        Nakamoto and Bitcoin became the first successful implementation of a
        secure decentralized blockchain solving the double spend problem for a
        digital currency.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
        <hr />
        Blockchains are decentralized peer-to-peer networks with a shared
        append-only ledger maintaining a consensus through a protocol. The
        unique characteristics of blockchains make them potentially
        transformative for a variety of industries requiring secure online
        transactions. They have the potential to solve a fundamental problem of
        digital trust whereby two individuals can perform almost any arbitrary
        transaction without a centralized trusted authority approving their
        transaction. Financial transactions are a natural starting place for
        blockchain technology, however, with the development of smart contract
        technology numerous applications can be adopted such as voting, supply
        chain, electronic health records, estate and property records, and much
        more.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Hash functions</h3>
        <hr />
        Cryptographic hash functions are a key components of every blockchain.
        Common hash functions are MD5, SHA1, SHA2, SHA3. Hash functions convert
        data of any size into a digital string of a specific length called a
        hash. An example MD5 hash:
        <br />
        <br />
        MD5(“Golden”) = 7d2b88f5977b8a31c6193b4c81a43daf
        <br />
        <br />
        Cryptographic hash functions have special properties differentiating
        them from other hash functions such as one way computation. This means
        the computation of the hash from the input data is trivial, but finding
        an input from the hash function is practically impossible with current
        computational technology (based on a mathematical difficulty of
        factoring large numbers).
        <br />
        <br />
        The hash value obtained could then be fed into the hash function again
        and produce a new valid hash. This practice allows various structures of
        hashes with useful properties including the linear linked chains that
        connect blocks in a blockchain.
        <br />
        <br />
        The hash of a block is calculated on the entire data set included in the
        block. Thus, a change to any bit of data in the block will hash that as
        output. That altered hash is now included in the next block, which
        changes the output hash of the next block and so on until all blocks
        post alteration are altered. This is a crucial aspect of the
        immutability property of the blockchain.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Public key cryptography</h3>
        <hr />
        While chains of cryptographic hashes maintain the immutability of the
        blockchain, an additional cryptographic method called public key
        cryptography is needed to ensure that only those who own an entity on
        the blockchain such as a cryptocurrency token are able to initiate a
        transaction. Public key cryptography is based on a pair of keys called
        the public and private key (digital signature key). The public key is
        open and widely distributed, while the private key is kept secret and
        only know to the owner.
        <br />
        <br />
        Access to private keys represent full ownership over something of value,
        typically a token or coin on the blockchain. As shown in the figure
        below the holding both the public and private keys allows for the
        creation of a digital signatures. The digital signature proves that the
        transaction came from the private key owner; no one without the key
        could impersonate the signature, and if the private key remains
        confidential to the owner they could not deny having processed the
        transaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="https://golden-media.s3.amazonaws.com/topic_images/bitcoin.pdf_2017-10-05_10-25-32.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        Nodes verify valid transactions by checking that the digital signature
        was generated by the private key and the owner has enough value in their
        account to complete the transaction — this is simple for blockchains
        like bitcoin where nodes simply need to verify that the sender has
        enough unspent coins.
        <br />
        <br />
        Turing complete smart contract platforms such as Ethereum require nodes
        to re-run smart contract codes and verify that sufficient resources are
        available to run the computations.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Replication</h3>
        <hr />
        Each full node on the network replicates a history of all transactions
        on the blockchain. In addition to full nodes, some blockchains allow for
        other type of nodes like lightweight or spv nodes — which may contain
        only specific portions of the blockchain. The size of the blockchain
        increases over time which increases the capacity requirements to run a
        full nodes. This an important parameter for decentralized blockchain
        networks as increasing blockchain size comes with increased cost of
        storage for each user. The implications of trade-offs between blockchain
        size and numerous other factors has been a topic of significant debate
        within the bitcoin and cryptocurrency communities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Consensus</h3>
        <hr />
        Blockchains use a variety of methods to determine consensus or agreement
        on the current state of the blockchain. At their core, all consensus
        mechanisms rely on financial incentives based on game theory, and the
        assumptions that users will act in their own monetary self interest.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, most blockchains utilize consensus protocols with
        proof-of-work. Proof-of-work requires nodes to compete for a financial
        reward by solving complex computational puzzles and win the privilege of
        mining the next block in the chain. The Proof-of-work protocol was
        originally developed to deter denial of service attacks, and is designed
        such that the majority of computation power or hashrate controls has
        control of the network. Adversarial nodes must compete against the
        totality of the hashrate of all non-colluding nodes in order to defraud
        the system. An adversarial majority node would also potentially favor
        generating new coins over attempting to undermine the system and the
        validity of their proportion of the network.
        <br />
        <br />
        Consensus emerges from independent verification of each transaction by
        each full node on the network. Blocks are added to blockchains through
        mining nodes at different intervals depending on how the protocol
        determines validity of blocks, and the participants ability to create
        those new blocks. Nodes then verify the new blocks and construct the
        chain. Nodes then select which blockchain they prefer, typically based
        on cumulative proof-of-work demonstrated on the longest chain, and
        consensus emerges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note, that there are many alternative consensus mechanisms under active
        development producing blockchains, or distributed ledgers, with vastly
        different properties. Some of these consensus mechanisms rely on
        differing protocols like proof-of-stake (dPoS, Casper, Ourobouros, etc),
        proof-of-capacity, proof-of-coin age, proof-of-burn, proof-of-authority,
        and many more.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Transactional logic and smart contracts</h3>
        <hr />
        Transactional logic on blockchains can be simple, such as the
        transactions of value in bitcoin, or arbitrarily complex code found in
        smart contracts employed by Ethereum and other blockchains.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Public blockchains</h3>
        <hr />
        The history of transactions on the blockchain, including all
        transactions made by each address, is permanently open and visible to
        everyone. However, the identity of person operating a particular node is
        pseudo-anonymous. New addresses can be easily created on the blockchain
        without necessarily linking to an individual’s name. For example, if the
        Bitcoin or Ethereum address of an individual is discovered it becomes
        trivial to find all transactions performed with that address with tools
        such as Bitcoin block explorer or Etherscan.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Private & permissioned blockchains</h3>
        <hr />
        Permissioned blockchains are different from public blockchains because
        the nodes allowed to participate in the network are restricted in some
        way. Projects developing private or permissioned blockchains include
        JPMorgan's Quorum, Multichain, R3, EWF, B3i, and many others.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Blockchain Forks</h3>
        <hr />
        Blocks may be added to two separate chains causing a fork. There are two
        kinds of forks — hard forks & soft forks. Hard forks cause a split in
        the blockchain; resulting in two separate and different permanent
        blockchains. These blockchains share the blocks prior to the fork; and
        have different blocks and data after the fork. A soft fork is a change
        to the protocol which does not result in different versions of the
        blockchain.
        <br />
        <br />
        Disagreements within blockchain communities on changes to the blockchain
        protocol have resulted in significant controversy, most famously the
        bitcoin block size debate resulting in the Bitcoin Cash hardfork. Other
        controversial hard forks include the Ethereum hard fork due to The DAO
        vulnerability and hack, resulting in the blockchain Ethereum Classic
        blockchain.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Identity</h3>
        <hr />
        In September 2017 the Swiss city of Zug announced intent to release an
        app to secure its citizens personal identity on the blockchain and
        associate it with a crypto address. Citizens would register
        independently on the app and then would be verified by city officials.
        The linking of a traditional personal centralized identity with a
        decentralized crypto-address is one initiative intended to improve
        digital identity. It is intended as a digital passport on the blockchain
        that could be used for various services such as e-voting. Zug is part of
        what is known as crypto valley, a region in Switzerland known for
        attracting decentralized and crypto entrepreneurship due to its
        crypto-friendly legislation.

        <hr />
        <h4>Singapore</h4>
        The Monetary Authority of Singapore released a report announcing project
        Urbin, a report outlining plans for increased usage of blockchains in
        Singapore.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Russia</h4>
        Russia has plans to release a cryptographic version of their national
        currency, and are calling it cryptoruble. The cryptoruble cannot be
        mined; and will be controlled and maintained by central Russian
        authorities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>International Monetary Fund</h4>
        The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Christine Lagarde have spoken
        publicly about the potential of cryptocurrency and the possibility for
        an IMF based coin.

        Bitcoin is a <a href="/wiki/cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> and a
        digital payment system invented by an unknown programmer, or a group of
        programmers, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as
        open-source software in 2009.
        <br />
        <br />
        The system is peer-to-peer, and transactions take place between users
        directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by
        network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the
        blockchain. Since the system works without a central repository or
        single administrator, bitcoin is called the first decentralized digital
        currency.
        <br />
        <br />
        Besides being obtained by proof-of-work (PoW) "mining", bitcoins can be
        exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
        <br />
        <br />
        As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accept bitcoin
        as payment. According to a research produced by University of Cambridge
        in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users actively using a
        cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        Pioneering work on digital currencies prior to bitcoin was done by David
        Chaum, who published on blind signatures as the basis for untraceable
        electronic cash and mail throughout the 1980’s. Wei Dai proposed B-money
        in 1998, which contained the idea of generation of money through the
        solving of computational puzzles as well novel methods for reaching
        consensus among network participants. Adam Back introduced the Hashcash
        algorithm. Hal Finney later utilized Back’s hashcash when he introduced
        a reproducible proof of work (RPOW) token in 2005. Nick Szabo proposed
        Bit gold in 2008, a digital currency which utilizes a proof of work
        puzzle that is securely timestamped and contains links between
        transactions.
        <br />
        <br />
        On October 31st 2008, an individual or group of individuals under the
        pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin whitepaper called
        “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". The open source code
        for bitcoin was released on January 9, 2009. The identity of Satoshi
        Nakamoto remains unknown, however they are thought to retain the largest
        known bitcoin wallet containing approximately 1 million bitcoins. No
        bitcoins have ever been transferred from this account to date.
        <br />

        CBOE launched Bitcoin futures trading on December 10, 2017. After
        experiencing a surge in price almost immediately the exchange halted
        trading for two minutes due to the volatility. CME group announced on
        October 31, 2017 that it intends to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth
        quarter of 2017. The futures will be based on the CME Bitcoin Reference
        Rate and will be cash settled.

        <h3>Transactions</h3>
        <hr />
        The creation & validation of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain,
        along with the appending of these transactions to the Bitcoin
        blockchain, is the core feature of the Bitcoin network and most
        cryptocurrency in general. Transactions are created by the owner of the
        bitcoins, who generate a specific digital signature using the private
        keys to create a valid transaction. Any transaction broadcast to the
        network without a valid digital signature will not be validated and
        propagated by the honest nodes in the network and will fail to be added
        to the blockchain. All transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain are
        globally and publicly visible.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>UTXO</h3>
        <hr />
        The Bitcoin transaction system is based on the unspent transaction
        outputs (UTXOs) model. A new UTXO is created each time a transaction is
        created in a new Bitcoin block with a new output. The UTXO is eliminated
        when the owner of the keys initiates a transaction which empties all of
        the Bitcoin.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <hr />
        There are a variety of assumptions made by the Bitcoin protocol with
        regards to transaction security and validity. The double spend attack or
        majority attack is possible when the attacker controls a larger portion
        of the mining power in the network, most effective at 50%. To date, no
        double spending attacks have occurred on Bitcoin, however multiple
        attacks on smaller chains such as Bitcoin Gold, Zencash, monacoin, and
        others have been successful. During the time that the attack controls
        this ability they are able to reverse specific arbitrary transactions by
        re-mining blocks with those transactions excluded. Thus cryptocurrency
        exchanges and others who accept large Bitcoin transactions typically
        wait for additional confirmation of blocks before relying on payment, as
        the cost to rewrite a transaction becomes larger the further back in the
        blockchain history it lies. The economic incentives for whether or not
        miners will benefit from attacking the network through a double spend
        rely on a number of factors and are actively debated.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to the majority attack, there are lower thresholds of mining
        power required potentially only 33% of the network has rate to to
        perform other attacks such as selfish mining.

        A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to
        work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the
        transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the
        currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or
        specifically of digital currencies.
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="/wiki/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> became the first decentralized
        cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been
        created. These are frequently called altcoins, as a blend of bitcoin
        alternative. Bitcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control as
        opposed to centralized electronic money/centralized banking systems. The
        decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin's blockchain
        transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.

          Cryptocurrency
        </a>
        is defined as a group of binary data that acts as a medium of exchange,
        or currency. Cryptocurrencies are usually fiat currencies, as they are
        not backed by, or convertible into, a commodity like gold.
        Cryptocurrency transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralized
        system that uses cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority
        like a bank.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most cryptocurrencies are built to run on{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/blockchain">blockchains</a>. Blockchains are records of
        cryptocurrency transactions made up of individual "blocks" that are
        formed with each transaction and linked together with cryptography.
        Blocks are all tied to and built off of the previous blocks behind it,
        which reinforces the chain it creates. Each block is made up of a
        cryptographic hash of the last block, a date and timestamp, and other
        data related to the transaction the block is referencing. Blocks and
        blockchains are very difficult, but not impossible, to modify due to
        each block's ties to the next: any data alteration affects every other
        subsequent block in the chain.

        <h3>Base layer protocols</h3>
        Base layer protocols are the peer-to-peer networks which form the basis
        of the Decentralized application (dApp) web. These base protocols are
        typically blockchains with an associated cryptocurrency coin secured by
        a consensus protocol where participants in the network decide
        collectively on the addition of new blocks to the blockchain ledger.
